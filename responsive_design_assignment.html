        A community staple on Brady street known for its "funky" vibe and delicious coffee made with locally roasted
        organic beans. The customer service is better than any cafe I've visited. The barista's are friendly and will happily reccommend you a drink to your liking. You can tell their drinks are made with care and the coffee is always fresh.
